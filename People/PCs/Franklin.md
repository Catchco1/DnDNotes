# [[Franklin]]

## Pregame Homework

### What is your character’s biggest ambition/goal in life?

Franklin really just wants to provide for the people who live in his neighborhood by helping them solve problems with magical items/trinkets. He would be happy to settle down and do that but is constantly being badgered by outside forces (state, guilds, crime). He loves to create new things and will often reach out to people he knows to offer his services at generous friends and family discounts just to help them out.

### What is your Character’s most prized possession?

Franklin has worked the entire time he has been an artificer to augment his shell/armor to be both beautiful and more protective. It is less of a possession now and more of a part of him as he has added magic and art.

### What is their biggest secret?

The circumstances of the ownership of Franklin’s shop. (Using Matthew’s Lich idea but making it a bit nicer). Franklin does not actually own the building but neither does the city. Imagine the house from Up where it was just there and everything else got built around it and so everyone wants to bulldoze it to make room for bigger buildings but Franklin lives there and pays [[Feng]], who does not live in the city, a flat rate every month. This rate has not increased because [[Feng]] has no real concept of the economy in the city. Feng is a stickler for the bills, but has let Franklin do whatever he wants to the house/shop building.

### Biggest strengths?

Franklin is committed to providing for his community. He can often analyze a situation quickly and devise a plan that would improve a particular system. For example, he built a small irrigation system for his neighbors, the [[Wallanby|Wallanby's]] (a dwarvish couple who own a fruit stand) as soon as he realized that the fruit was small due to inefficient watering cycles. He has been particularly interested in agriculture improvements as a hobby, but always focused on armor given his natural predisposition (shell).

### Biggest weaknesses?

Franklin is a stubborn tortle. He has a particular way of doing things, especially within his shop (and more broadly in his work in general). He never keeps an apprentice for very long because they get fed up with how he wants things done a particular way, and also how he tends to give excessive friends and family discounts.

### Who do they know in town/friends?

#### State

[[Jim Pentacoste]] (Elf tax collector) - Franklin and [[Jim Pentacoste|Jim]] have known each other for a while and Jim understands Franklin wanting his own space rather than working for the city. However, Jim must do his job and collect the taxes. They are not necessarily close friends, but friendly acquaintances who see each other as just doing their jobs.

#### Neighbors

The [[Wallanby|Wallanby's]].

#### Guilds

[[Darya Winterthistle]] (Human Defense guild higher-up) was a close friend of Franklin’s when she moved to the city a few years ago. She used to work in his shop but got a better apprenticeship about a year after they met. They originally held similar views of the guilds and the city leadership, but grew apart over time. However, she gradually became more interested in what the guilds had to offer and began working to gain a position of authority within the Defense guild. This caused a slight rift in their relationship, but they are still friendly with one another. Mostly, they just do not see each other as often.

### Who do they have a grudge against/enemies?

#### State/Guilds

[[Charles Catskill]] (Gnomish inventor who is a higher-up in the weapons guild). Charles has repeatedly tried to convince Franklin to join the guilds and make weapons for the army/militia of the city. Franklin has said no every time, but Charles is trying to force his hand as one of the few remaining independent merchants in the city. Previous attempts include sending absurd gifts to make Franklin feel indebted to the guilds, raising Franklin’s taxes, and maybe even sending a few low-level thugs from one of the syndicates to give him a stern talking to. (If the syndicate thing is allowed Franklin either just hid in his shell until the guys got bored or they just broke some stuff in his shop and didn’t actually hurt him).

#### Crime Syndicate
#DeMutta 

See previous bit about some unfortunate circumstances with the syndicates. However, more generally Franklin tries his best to provide for the community, which makes the syndicates nervous because he provides means of protection without the need for fear or control.

#### Give me a couple of life-defining events you’ve been through and why you came to town

Franklin was a traveler before he came to the city, but decided to settle down because he loved the city. He has been there for about 25-30 years but has only been an artificer for about 10. He loved the city because of its proximity to water, but he also fell in love with the people who lived here. Every year at the annual magical item showcase festival, Franklin displays his shell as well as a few other projects. One particular year before the guilds had decided to be more antagonistic towards him, he won an award for the best apprentice armor thus making a name for himself in the city outside of just other merchants.

### Shop Name

[[ShellTex]] is located in [[The Reef]]. 

### Mentor

[[Lazarus "Doc" Starbright]] currently alive but no longer lives in the city (visits occasionally and has a good relationship with Franklin)

Doc is a classic Gnome tinkerer.

### Appearance

He looks like an anthropomorphized sea turtle, complete with a blue-green shell. The center of each plate of the shell is green and it fans out to blue towards the edges.

His shell glows blue with magic when he uses magic or any of his shell's abilities.

He has a wide head and blue eyes that match the same blue on his shell.

He stands around 5'11".

He is 80 and 1/2 years old, young for a tortle (they can live around 400 years) but old enough to have been around the world for a bit.

He has big hands which make some wonder how he can possibly accomplish any of his tinkering, but he manages.
