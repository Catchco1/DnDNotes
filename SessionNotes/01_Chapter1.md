#Synopsis

We met our characters! Starting with [[Franklin]], then [[Pops]], and [[The Fella]].

Opening scene was [[Franklin]] getting roughed up by [[Sol DeMutta]] for his shell skematics and savings. [[Sol DeMutta|Sol]] gave Franklin a flyer to a fight between [[Murderbot 3000]] and [[Tina Stonebearer]]. 

Next we went to [[KaibraCo]], the gym that Pops owns. The Fella was hiding in a broom closet after getting in through a broken window. After some hijinks between meeting [[Hamilton]], Franklin shows up to ask where the fight is going to be. More Fella related hijinks. 

Franklin moves to leave, and runs into the [[Wallanby|Wallanby's]] fruit stand outside. He chats with them for a bit and buys some fruit, and The Fella walks up and tries to get as many tomatoes as possible. More hijinks. [[Slagnor and Karen]] walk up and offer "ethically sourced lizardperson meat" gained by killing local tribes in the [[Valley of Death]]. Slagnor rides [[Slippy]], a basilisk. 

[[Throg Stonebearer]] yells across [[Telnazzi Square]] for Pops. They have an agrument about whether Tina should fight Murderbot 3000. Conversation ends with Pops saying he will try to talk her out of the fight, even though he has full faith in her ability to win. 

Franklin and The Fella go back to Franklin's shop and The Fella runs into Franklin's Homunculus servant. More hijinks.

Session ends with some downtime preparing to attend the fight that night.
